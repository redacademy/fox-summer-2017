                </div>
                <p>Through my speaking engagements, I share what personal insights and realizations I’ve collected from my own experiences, and through my interactions with the natural world.
				<br></br>I strive for us to connect more  with nature and with one another. 
				<br></br>In a world so fast-paced and filled with endless distractions, it’s easy to get caught up in a more materialistic way of thinking. I encourage myself and the peers I share with to be aware of what’s truly valuable in life, and to use our connection with nature as a constant reminder to exist in the moment.
