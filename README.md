## LEARNINGS
In this project we learned how to work as a team, from the design hand-off process with the UI and UX Designers to using a git workflow for teams during development. We learned how to resolve merge conflicts and to create this website based on the designers' prototypes on InVision. We learned WordPress custom theming and plugin development. We also learned the use of Migrate DB Pro to push, pull and sync WordPress database tables.
